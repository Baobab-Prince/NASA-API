# NASA-API
Picture of the Day
This app provides the user with NASA's Picture of the Day. Everyday the API uploads a different picture. I used "particle.js" to add embellishments to the page.
Particle.js is a lightweight, dependency-free and responsive javascript plugin for particle backgrounds. I hope you enjoy!
